# Puzzle app — tech stack and timeline (initial)

## Engine / client options
### Option A: Unity (fastest path to polished casual game)
- Unity Personal is listed as **free**; Unity says **Pro is required for businesses with over $200K in funding or annual revenue** (per their plans page). Source: https://unity.com/products

### Option B: Godot (open source, no engine licensing fees)
- Godot Engine is **free and open source under the permissive MIT license**; you can use it for any purpose, including commercial. Source: https://godotengine.org/license/

### Option C: Flutter + Flame (if UI-heavy “puzzle app” with lighter game loop)
- Flutter’s casual games toolkit markets **no seat charges or usage fees** and multiplatform deployment; points to Flame as a community 2D game engine. Source: https://flutter.dev/games

## Suggested MVP scope + timeline (solo/2-person)
- Week 1: core loop prototype (one puzzle type), basic UI, local progression.
- Week 2: content pipeline (levels/daily), analytics events, ad placeholders.
- Week 3: polish + tutorial + retention hooks (streaks, daily rewards), integrate ads + IAP.
- Week 4: beta + store listings + instrumentation + soft launch.

## Notes / next data to add
- Add backend stack recommendation (Firebase/Supabase) and rationale.
- Add release checklist items based on Apple review guidelines. Source: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/
