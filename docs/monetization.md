# Puzzle app — monetization (initial notes)

## Common monetization primitives (platform-defined)
- Apple describes three types of in-app purchases: **subscriptions**, **non-consumable** (e.g., remove ads, full game unlock, bonus levels), and **consumable** (e.g., coins/gems, extra health). Source: https://support.apple.com/en-us/102383
- Google Play service fees overview: **15% for first $1M revenue/year** (then 30% above), and **subscriptions 15%** for auto-renewing subscriptions. Source: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/112622?hl=en

## Implications for a puzzle game
- F2P puzzle games typically mix: rewarded ads + interstitials + IAP (consumables like hints/coins; non-consumable remove-ads; occasional content packs).
- Subscription can work if there’s ongoing value (daily puzzles, streak features, offline packs, advanced analytics, custom modes).

## Notes / next data to add
- Add competitor monetization examples (Candy Crush, Royal Match, etc.) using store listings / official pages.
- Add rough unit economics ranges (ad eCPM, IAP conversion) from credible mobile gaming sources.
