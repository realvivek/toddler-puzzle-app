# Project 1: Cultural Toddler Puzzle — Dashboard Mockup & Templates

## 1. Top 3 Unity Templates (Non-Dev Friendly)
I’ve identified three templates that prioritize "Drag & Drop" and easy asset swapping.

*   **Animal Puzzle Match 2D (Unity Asset Store):**
    *   **Vibe:** Very simple, perfect for kids 1–5.
    *   **Why it works:** It has a built-in progress system and level unlocker. We just swap "Lion" for "Taj Mahal".
    *   **Cost:** ~$20–$30.
*   **Kids Educational Puzzle Game (Codester):**
    *   **Vibe:** Specifically designed for toddler UI (large buttons, high contrast).
    *   **Why it works:** Includes sound effect triggers for correct/incorrect drops, which is great for the "Cultural Education" aspect.
*   **Custom "Drag & Drop" Script (GitHub/Tutorial-based):**
    *   **Vibe:** Bare-bones.
    *   **Why it works:** If we want absolute control and no licensing fees, I can adapt a clean open-source script and build the UI from scratch in Unity.

## 2. Initial Asset List (MVP)
*   **Landmarks:** Taj Mahal (Agra), Hawa Mahal (Jaipur), Gateway of India (Mumbai).
*   **Festivals:** Diwali (Diyas/Lanterns), Holi (Colors/Pichkari).
*   **Icons:** Peacock (National Bird), Tiger (National Animal).
