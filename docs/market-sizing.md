## High-level mobile opportunity
- Sensor Tower (State of Mobile 2024 landing page) notes that across the top 10 markets, weighted average **time spent on mobile surpassed 5 hours in 2023**, up 2% YoY; and after declining 2% YoY in 2022, **global consumer spending bounced back 4%**. This is directional context for a consumer mobile product, but not puzzle-specific. Source: https://sensortower.com/state-of-mobile-2024
